# The TinyKV

The TinyKV builds a key-value storage system with the Raft consensus algorithm. It is inspired by [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) and [TiKV Project](https://github.com/tikv/tikv).

After completing this, you will have the knowledge to implement a horizontally scalable, highly available, key-value storage service with distributed transaction support. Also, you will have a better understanding of TiKV architecture and implementation.
